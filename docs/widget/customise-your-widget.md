# Customising your widget
You can customise the widget to match your brand colours and the style of your website. This can all be done via your BookingBug dashboard.

Additionally, you can customise the CSS code to get further control of the widget. This is useful if you want to customise the font, for example.

<span class="help-block">You can find these settings here [http://bookingbug.com/conf/inset/view_insets](http://uk.bookingbug.com/conf/inset/view_insets)</span>

As well as the colours you can choose the size of the widget

You may have further requirements for your booking journey and you may need to customise it past what the widget can offer.
