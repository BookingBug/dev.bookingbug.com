# Embed your widget
The booking bug widget allows you to embed your booking journey into your own web site using a small snippet of code. You can find this snippet in your BookinBug account. As shown in the image below.

Once you've copy and pasted the snippet of code into your web page. You can then visit that page  in your browser and it will load the your widget. This is all you need to do for a basic integration. If you want to customise the look of your widget you can do this via your account dashboard.

## Book now button
You can also embed a book now button instead of the widget. This is similar to the widget except it directs the user to your widget hosted on our servers. You can customise the colour the button to match your brand as shown in the image below.
