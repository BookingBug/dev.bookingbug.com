# Choosing your plan
The first thing you will need to do is find out which type of account you will need with BookingBug. To find this out you need to know how many of the following you require.

- **Staff** - This is the amount of staff members that you will need on the system. For example, if you offer appointment based advise then each staff member who can take that appointment will need to be on the system.
- **Bookings (PCM)** The number of bookings you expect to take each month
- **Resources** - These are physical bookable items that are needed for the booking such as a tennis court, if your a coach, a boat if you are renting out boats. a studio or a desk.
