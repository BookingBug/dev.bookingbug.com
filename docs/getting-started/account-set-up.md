- **Step one** Choose your business type for example day based events, appointments or class and courses (we will be using appointments for this example).
- **Step two** Select the most appropriate service type. So for appointments you can choose between restaurant, rental, instructor based classes.
- **Step three** Set basic business information such as the name of the service/duration and the name of the staff member that this service relates to (this would apply mainly to instructor based services).
- **Step four** Set up working hours and pricing. This is the times of the week you offer the service and how much the appointment costs.
- **Step five** Configure your business and publish you service booking.
