- **Step one** Choose your business type for example day based events, appointments or class and courses (we will be using appointments for this example).
- **Step two** Select the most appropriate service type. So for appointments you can choose between restaurant, rental, instructor based classes.
- **Step three** Set basic business information such as the name of the service/duration and the name of the staff member that this service relates to (this would apply mainly to instructor based services).
- **Step four** Set up working hours and pricing. This is the times of the week you offer the service and how much the appointment costs.
- **Step five** Configure your business and publish you service booking.

> You can also customise the colours and size of your embedded widget via your account.

Now you can start using BookingBug in your own site. You can embed the BookingBug widget by copy and pasting the widget code into your website.

Alternatively you can take advantage of the optional public site that BookingBug hosts for you. You can add a book now button to your own site to direct users to the public site.

You can also integrate your new booking journey with Facebook, Drupal and [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bookingbug/).

You may have further requirements for your booking journey and you may need to customise it past what the embed widget can offer.
