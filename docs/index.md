# Getting Started

The BookingBug Platform is an extensive tool-set that allows web developers and designers of all skill levels, backgrounds and experience to make the best use of the broad range of functionality, flexibility and power that BookingBug offers businesses.

## Set up your platform
To start using the platform the first thing you will need to do is choose a plan that suits your needs. If none of the service levels available meet your needs, then you may require an enterprise account. To find out more contact [BookingBug for a quote](https://www.bookingbug.co.uk/contact).

## Widget

The easiest way to implement the BookingBug platform into your website is to use the widget. This widget is a snippet of code that can be embedded into any web page.

## JavaScript SDK

The BookingBug JavaScript SDK is built on AngularJS and runs on BookingBug’s underlying REST API. This is the easiest way to implement the BookingBug service into your application.

## REST API

Our REST API allows you to integrate the BookingBug system into your application. You have more power over the way it integrates compared to the JavaScipt SDK. This is great if you want to integrate the platform with a native mobile app. However for most websites the JavaScript SDK should provide you with all that you need.
