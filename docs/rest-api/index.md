# REST API

The BookingBug REST API is a [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) based API that allows you to manage all aspects of the BookingBug platform. It is a lot faster and easier to get started with the JavaScript SDK, which has all the features of the API and more. However if you are using the platform within a mobile app or simply require deeper integration, then the API is what you will need.

This documentation will cover the main aspects of the API and how you can use it within your application. There are many different features within the API and we will only be covering some of the aspects that you will need to get set up. If you have further questions regarding the use of the API then you can email support@bookingbug.com

For a full list of end points and methods see the [API Reference](http://apidocs.bookingbug.com/)

> The company_id variable is the number you'll see at the top right of the screen when you log into your BookingBug account. E.g: ukw12359.
