# REST API

The BookingBug REST API is a [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) based API that allows you to manage all aspects of your booking bug platform. It is a lot faster an easier to get started with the JavaScript SDK which has all the features of the API plus more. However if your using the platform within a mobile app or simply require deeper integration then the API is what you will need.

This documentation will cover the main aspects of the API and how you can use it within your application. There are many different features within the API and we will only be covering some of the aspects that you will need to get set up. If you have further questions regarding the use of the API then you can email support@bookingbug.com

<!-- Better yet if its a very specific question for developers post it on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=bookingbug) and include the word bookingbug (all one word) and with any luck someone will come to the rescue. -->
