# Service Booking
There are two main types of booking that can be done through via the BookingBug platform. These are split into service bookings and event bookings. In this section we will be looking at service bookings.

## User Flow
Before you start building an integration with the REST API it is important to plan out your user flow. Below is a UML Diagram of our standard user flow. Each stage has an action that the user carries out and each stage requires certain API calls.

We will be looking at these stages of the user flow and which API calls to make at each stage.

- Store Locator
- List Stores
- List Service
- List Available Slots
- Collect User Details
- Confirmation

## Store Locator
The first call you will need to make to the API is to `GET <company-id>` to retrieve the company object. This shows the parent company and a list of child companies. You can then use this company object to find the nearest branch/location to the location your user has entered.

## List Stores
With the company object, you can display the nearest locations to the user that are available. The user can then choose from one of these stores.

## List Services
Once your user has chosen a location then you can list the services available at that location. This can be done with `GET <company_id>/services` method. This will return the service object. Among other things, you will get back the `booking_time_step` which is the length of the appointment. The `duration_unit` which tells us what the time step is measured in for, example 30 minutes.

> To see the full object that gets returned you can call the end point directly using CURL or a tool such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)

## List Available Slots
Listing the available slots uses the `GET /time_data` API method. You can then pass in different parameters such as your time frame on the end of the API call for example `?service_id=<service_id>&date=YYYY-MM-DD&end_date=YYYY-MM-DD&duration=60`

You can also pass in a `person_id` or a `resource_id`.

## Collect User Details
This is the point where your user would enter their details before booking the appointment. You will need two API calls at this stage.

The First call is `GET /questions` this returns the questions that relate to that particular service. For example, if we were to be creating a booking appointment for financial services, then at this point we could ask if the user has a standard or business account or if they have already started the process of finding a mortgage with other financial providers.

The Second call is `GET /client_details` This returns the default client details you need to collect. Such as age, first name, last name, email, phone number and if you would like to receive a newsletter.

## Confirmation
Once you've got to the confirmation section and your user has filled in their details. you can create or update the client by email and add the item to their basket. This is achieved with `POST basket/add_item?service_id=<service_id>`

after this has been done you can confirm your user. Or you can have them check the details one more time and then click a confirm booking button. Once you are ready to put the booking through the system you will need to hit the `POST /basket/checkout` end point to complete the booking.
