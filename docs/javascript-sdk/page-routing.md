# Page Routing

The JavaScript SDK has a page routing system that automatically follows a set of steps. These steps make up your user journey. These page directives can be customised via the `bb-breadcrumb` directive.

In this guide, we will be taking a newly initialised widget that we created and customise the default templates which it invokes.

To start let's look at our `bb-widget` directive

```js
<div bb-widget="{
  company_id: '12345',
  clear_member: true,
  route_format: '/{page}'
  }" 

  bb-scroll-to="page:loaded" class="container">
   
</div>
```

By default, this will look for the `main.html` template. This `main.html` template allows you to set up a global template for the journey such as a header and footer and, in this case, a breadcrumb to control the page routing. Any content within this `<div>` will be treated as main content and loaded for each step of the journey.

The SDK calls `$Scope.defineNextPage` to automatically take you through the default steps of the booking journey. You can use the `bb-breadcrumbs` directive to override this.

```js
<div bb-breadcrumbs class="breadcrumbs_holder" ng-init="setRoute([
    {page:'event_list', title: 'Select a date'},
    {page:'event', title: 'Select tickets'},
    {page:'checkout_event', title: 'Checkout'},
    {page:'confirmation', title: 'Finish'}
    ])">
</div>
```

This allows you to set up custom page routes for your user journey. The `page:''` attributes allows you to set the template that is used for each step, so `page:'event_list'` would load the `events_list.html` template for that step. The `title:` allows you to change the `<title>` meta tag for the page.

You can also pass `disable_breadcrumbs: true` to disable a step once the user has loaded the step in question. This means that they cannot go back once it has been set.

```js
<div bb-breadcrumbs class="breadcrumbs_holder" ng-init="setRoute([
    {page:'event_list', title: 'Select a date'},
    {page:'event', title: 'Select tickets'},
    {page:'checkout_event', title: 'Checkout', disable_breadcrumbs: true},
    {page:'confirmation', title: 'Finish'}
    ])">
</div>
```

The example above would not allow a user to go back once they have loaded the checkout step.

## Combining Steps

You may want to combine multiple steps. You can do this using `when: route.event[slot, person]` or `when: route.event[date, time]`. This combines the directives into one step allowing you to create a custom template to suit your needs. The different steps available are as follows.

- Company
- Category
- Service
- Person
- Resource
- Duration
- Date
- Time
- Client
- Summary
- Basket 
- Checkout 
- Slot
- Event
- Login

However, we do have an issue here. If we define `when: route.event[slot, person]` on confirmation it will try to call `$Scope.defineNextPage` twice. We also may want to change the available slots when the user chooses a person.

to overcome this we can use the `bb-page` controller. This controller allows you to route steps back and forth when combining steps. You can attach `checkReady()` to the step DOM element. And it will wait until all of the steps in a single template have been completed as per the below example.

```
<div bb-page>

  <div bb-item-details>
    <!-- template -->
  </div>

  <div bb-client-details>
    <!-- template -->
  </div>

  <button type="button" ng-click="checkReady() && routeReady()">
    Next
  </button>


</div>
```
