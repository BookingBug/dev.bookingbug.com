# JavaScript SDK Overview
The JavaScript SDK provides an Angular based set of tools that allows you to set up custom user journeys in your application.

It is designed to be extremely simple to use, even for someone with only basic HTML skills and no JavaScript experience. It is also designed to be flexible and powerful enough to enable even the most demanding or sophisticated use cases.

The benefits of using the JavaScript SDK is that it does a lot of the heavy lifting for you. Allowing you to implement the service without having to directly integrate the API, which can be quite a bit of work.
