# JavaScript SDK Overview
The JavaScript SDK provides an AngularJS based set of tools that allows you to set up custom user journeys in your application.

It is designed to be extremely simple to use, even for someone with only basic HTML skills and no JavaScript experience. It is also designed to be flexible and powerful enough for you to create even the most sophisticated booking widgets.

The benefits of using the JavaScript SDK is that it does a lot of the heavy lifting for you. It will allow you to implement the type of widget you want without you having to directly integrate the API: a much more complicated task.
