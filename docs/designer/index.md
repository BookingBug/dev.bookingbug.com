## Using the Designer

We have created a BookingBug designer available at [https://designer.bookingbug.com/](https://designer.bookingbug.com/). This allows you to extend the widget. Adding your own styles and adapting the layout to suit your needs.

This can then be downloaded as a template ready for integration into your site and deployment.

If your comfortable with development and you would prefer to use a local development environment rather than our in browser designer you can extend the SDK following the instructions below.
